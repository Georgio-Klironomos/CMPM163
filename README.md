  Part A:
 This scene displays three objects being affected by three lights. The capsule uses a classic Phong shader, the cube uses a combined Phong and texture shader, and the sphere uses a vertex displacement shader.
  Part B:
 This scene shows 2 similar quads, each with an input Blur shader. The inputs for each object is the Y-position of the mouse, but they are opposites, to mimic a focus effect.
  Part C:
 This scene has two examples of the ping-pong effect of shaders: THe right object shows off a colored and modified version of Conway's Game of Life rule set, and the left shader uses a simple reaction-diffusion shader.
