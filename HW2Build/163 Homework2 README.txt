Homework 2 ReadMe
Georgio Klironomos
        For this homework I combined both parts into one scene for ease of grading. For Part 1, I used a 3D model of the Buddha and added an outline shader to it. This combined with the blur shader on the camera produces a glow around the head and the orbs surrounding it. In addition, the head has a child model with an xray shader on it, which I learned to apply using the youtube tutorial. This shader allows the model to be seen through the water and through the scene’s mirror.
        For part 2, I used the in class example of the heightmap terrain, and combined that with a water plane that uses a modified reflection shader to reflect the skybox I made from a picture (which I got from the HDRI haven website). The user can affect the height of the water as well as the mirror’s position, the head’s position, and the bloom’s intensity.
